    "In this project, you will implement linear text classifiers for sentiment analysis. We will be working with [Stanford Sentiment Tree (SST) Bank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) which contains movie reviews with sentiment labels. We will consider both the binary version (only two labels positive and negative) as well as 5 label version (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive). In particular you will learn:\n",

These features can be of different types depending upon the downstream application, like for building a classifier to predict whether to give credit to a customer we might consider features like their age, income, employement status etc. In the same way to build a classifier for textual data, we need a way to describe each text example in terms of numeric features which can then be fed to the classification algorithm of our choice."

E.g. the features we defined above do not handle negation. Hence, in the example \"I would not recommend it\", \"recommend\" gets counted as a positive lexicon. While we can define features to handle such cases, it can get very tedius trying to capture all such cases.\n",

    "Bag of Words model is another method to encode documents into features and requires little manual interventions to define features In bag of words, we represent a document as an unordered collection of words in that document. One way this is commonly done is by counting occurence (or frequency) of each word in a given document and using it as a feature for training the classifier. The order in which these words occur in the text is not relevant and we are just concerned with which words are present in the text. Consider the following example to understand how bag of words are used to represent text.\n",

    "As you can see we have around 18k features for each example! This is specially concerning because our training dataset size is less than half of the number of features. This can very easily lead the model to overfit on training data. Recall that each feature corresponds to a word in the vocabulary. One way we can reduce the features is by normalizing words in the vocabulary. E.g. currently we have been treating lowercase and uppercase versions of a word as different words. We can apply *case folding* i.e. lowercasing all the words in our dataset. Another trick that can significantly reduce the number of features is to get rid of words which occur very rarely in the training data and replace them with an \\<unk\\> token. Similarly we can remove punctuations from the text. We can also get rid of the so called *stop-words*. These are the words which are very commonly used in a language but often do not carry significant meaning, e.g. \"the\", \"he\", \"for\" etc. NLTK package provides us a list of stop words which can be accessed by:\n",

Consider an input $\\pmb{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ defining the feature vector and label $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Recall from the lectures that logistic regression has the following functional form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = P(y = 1) = \\sigma(\\pmb{w}^T\\pmb{x} + b)$$\n",

    "### Exercise 2.3: Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression (4 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now start training our sentiment classifier. One of the most commonly used optimization algorithms used in machine (and deep) learning is gradient descent. Recall from lectures that in gradient descent we iteratively update the weights of the model in the opposite direction of the gradient of loss function w.r.t. to the weights, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta^{t + 1} = \\theta^t - \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\nabla_{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} L(f(x_i; \\theta), y_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for logistic regression, $L(f(x; \\theta), y ) = L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}, y)$. $\\theta$ here denotes the parameters of the model, which for us is simply the weights $\\pmb{w}$ and bias $b$. $\\eta$ is also called learning rate, which determines the strength of every the update (too low then the convergence will be slow and too high we might overshoot the local minima).\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient of the BCE loss w.r.t $\\pmb{w}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla_{w} L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i) = [ \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i)}{\\partial w_1}, \\cdots,  \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i)}{\\partial w_d}]^T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i)}{\\partial w_j} = - (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)x_{ij} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $x_{ij}$ refers to the $j^{th}$ feature of $i^{th}$ input.\n",
    "Similarly, for the bias term we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla_{b} L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i) = \\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{BCE}}(\\hat{y}_i, y_i)}{\\partial b} = - (y_i - \\hat{y}_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging these into our gradient descent equation we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w^{t+1}_j = w^{t}_j - \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)x_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b^{t+1} = b^{t} - \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin our implementation, there are two points to note. First you must have noticed that we sum over $m$ examples in our update equation. These are the all the examples in our training data. In practice, it can get very expensive to compute gradients w.r.t all examples, specially when we are dealing with huge datasets (millions or even billions of examples) and deep neural networks. In such cases, it is common to use stochastic or mini batch gradient descent, where for each update we only use a small batch of training data to update the weights (we use a different batch for every update till we exaust all the training data). An extreme case of this is where we only use one example at a time to update the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {w}^{t+1}_j = {w}^{t}_j - \\eta (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)x_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {b}^{t+1} = {b}^{t} - \\eta (\\hat{y}_i - y_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we wrote the above equations in terms of scalar variables and their summations. In practice, it can be much more efficient to vectorize these equations and use matrix operations which can make use of parallel computation. The vectorized version of our update rule will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\pmb{w}^{t+1} = \\pmb{w}^t - \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\pmb{X}^T(\\pmb{\\hat{y}} - \\pmb{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {b}^{t+1} = {b}^t - \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\pmb{1}_d^T(\\pmb{\\hat{y}} - \\pmb{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is the input matrix where each row is a feature vector for an input example. Similarly, $\\pmb{y} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{m}$ is the vector containing labels for each example and $\\pmb{\\hat{y}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the vector of predicted labels. $\\pmb{1}_d \\in {1}^d$ is a vector of all ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will implement `gradient_descent_update_vanilla` and `gradient_descent_update_vectorized`. The former using scalar operations and latter with vectorized update rule we described above.\n"

    "\n",
    "While cross entropy loss gives us some idea about the performance of model, it is not very interpretable. In practice it is common to use evaluation metrics that effectively capture the performance of the model while also being interpretable. For classification tasks, the most commonly used metric is accuracy, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{accuracy} = \\frac{\\mathbb{1}(y_{\\text{pred}} = y)}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $y_{pred}$ is the model's final prediction, which can be obtained from $\\hat{y}$ by checking if it is above a specific threshold $\\tau$ and predicting label 1 and 0 otherwise -- $y_{pred} = \\mathbb{1}(\\hat{y} > \\tau)$. $\\tau$ is typically set to 0.5. $n$ is the number of examples in the evaluation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other metrics that are useful to evaluate classifiers, especially the cases with class imbalance where accuracy might not be fully representative of the model's performance. These metrics involve precision, recall, and F1-score, which are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{precision} = \\frac{\\text{tp}}{\\text{tp} + \\text{fp}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{recall} =\\frac{\\text{tp}}{\\text{tp} + \\text{fn}}$$\n",

    "$$ \\text{f1-score} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where tp denotes true positives ($y = 1$ and $y_{\\text{pred}} = 1$), fp denotes false positives ($y = 0$ and $y_{\\text{pred}} = 1$), and fn denotes false negatives ($y = 1$ and $y_{\\text{pred}} = 0$)\n",

    "### Exercise 2.6: Interpreting Trained Logistic Regression Model (3 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of using linear models is that they are inherently interpretable. We can look at the weights of the model to understand which features are contributing to the model's decision. For BOW features, the weights correspond to the importance of each word in the vocabulary. A high value of the weight for a word indicates that the presence of that word in the text is indicative of a positive sentiment. Similarly, a low value of the weight for a word indicates that the presence of that word in the text is indicative of a negative sentiment. Implement the `interpret_logistic_regression` function below that takes in the model and the vocabulary and returns the top 10 words that contribute most to positive sentiment and top 10 words that contribute most to negative sentiment."

    "\n",
    "Tuning hyperparameters is an important part of building any Machine Learning model. For our logistic regression model, we have the following hyperparameters: learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and normalization methods. You can either perform a grid search on the hyperparameters or a random search (Read more [here](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/\\#hyper)). Example ranges for different hyperparameters include (you don't need to restrict to these)\n",
    "\n",
    "- learning rate: [1e-1, 1e-5] (it is a better idea to search for learning rates in logarithmic space than uniform, e.g. considering values like 1e-1, 5e-2, 1e-2, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch size: [8, 4196] (it is common to consider batch sizes as powers of 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "- epochs: [2, 1000] (1000 epochs is generally a lot and we rarely train deep learning models for this long. For smaller models and datasets like we have though, it is very much feasible and more epochs can lead to better fit)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Exercise 3.1: Multinomial Logistic Regression (2 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend logistic regression to multi-class classification, we can use the softmax function. For a vector $\\pmb{z} = [z_1, z_2, \\cdots, z_K]$ of K arbitrary real numbers, the softmax function maps them to a probability distribution with each value between 0 and 1 and summing to 1. The softmax function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\texttt{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{\\exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{j = 1}^K \\exp(z_j)} \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In multinomial logistic regression, we consider a weight vector $\\pmb{w}_k$ for each of the K classes, take dot product with input features (also adding a bias term unique for each class) to obtain scores or *logits* for each of the classes. We then apply the softmax function to get the probability distribution over the classes. Formally, this is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_k = P(y_k = 1 \\mid \\pmb{x}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\pmb{w}_k^T \\pmb{x} + b_k)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\exp(\\pmb{w}_j^T \\pmb{x} + b_j)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(y_k = 1 \\mid \\pmb{x})$ is the probability of the input $\\pmb{x}$ belonging to class $k$. $\\pmb{w}_k$ is the weight vector for class $k$, and $b_k$ is the bias term for class $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In practice, we often use a trick to make the computation of softmax more numerically stable. We subtract the maximum value from the logits before applying softmax. This does not change the output of softmax but can prevent numerical overflow. The softmax function with this trick is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\texttt{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{\\exp(z_i - \\max(\\pmb{z}))}{\\sum_{j = 1}^K \\exp(z_j - \\max(\\pmb{z}))} \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `MultinomialLogisticRegression` class below, which initializes the weights and biases for each class and provides a method to get the output from the model."

    "We will again evaluate our model using the same metrics as before. Note that for metrics precision and recall, for the multi-class case, we compute them for each class and then average them to get the final precision and recall. We consider each class one by one as positive (and others negative) and compute the precision and recall values. This is called macro-averaging. Accuracy can be computed in the same way as before and F1-score can be computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",

The element at row i and column j of the confusion matrix is the number of observations known to be in group i but predicted to be in group j.\n",
