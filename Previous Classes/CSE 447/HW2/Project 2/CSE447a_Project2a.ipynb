    "### Exercise 3.1 Sentence Similarity (3 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This part is adapted from Dan Jurafsky's NLP class CS124 at Stanford.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will be building sentence level representations using word embeddings and then use them to find similarity between two sentences. In particular your goal is to answer questions of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    True/False: the following two sentences are semantically similar:\n",
    "      1. he later learned that the incident was caused by the concorde's sonic boom\n",
    "      2. he later found out the alarming incident had been caused by concorde's powerful sonic boom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To build sentence level representations, you will use the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple sum**: Simply take the sum of word embeddings of all words in the sentence\n",
    "* **Sum with POS weighting**: Take a weighted sum of the individual word vectors, where the weight of each word depends on the part of speech tag (POS) of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will implement the following functions:\n",
    "* **get_sentence_embedding()**: given a sentence (string), return the sentence embedding (vector). The function also takes in the parameter `use_POS`:\n",
    "    * if `use_POS` is false (regular case), leverage method 1 above - simply the sum of the word embeddings for each word in the sentence (ignoring words that don’t appear in our vocabulary).\n",
    "    * if `use_POS` is true, leverage method 2 - use a weighted sum, where we weight each word by a scalar that depends on its part of speech tag.\n",
    "* **get_sentence_similarity()**: given two sentences, find the cosine similarity between their corresponding sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lowercase all words in the sentence before you look them up in the embeddings. The Glove embeddings that we are using have all words in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We’ve given you a map `POS_weights` that maps part of speech tags to their associated weight. For example, `POS_weights['NN'] = 0.8` (where NN is the POS tag for noun).\n",
    "* You may skip words that either (1) are not in our embeddings or (2) have a POS tag that is not in `POS_weights` . To check if a word is not in our embeddings, you can use the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    if glove_vectors.is_word_in_embeddings(word):\n",
    "        # word is in embeddings\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # word is not in embeddings\n",
    "```\n",
    "* To get a list of all the words in the sentence, use nltk's word_tokenize function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  >>> sentence = \"this is a sentence\"\n",
    "  >>> word_tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)\n",
    "  >>> word_tokens\n",
    "  ['this', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * To get the POS tags for each word in a sentence, you can use nltk.pos_tag. To use it, you provide a list of words in a sentence, and it returns a list of tuples, where the first element is the word and the second is its corresponding POS tag. **For this PA, make sure that you pass in the entire sentence to a single call to nltk.pos_tag; do not call  nltk.pos_tag separately on each word in the sentence.** This is because some words can be multiple parts of speech (for example, \"back\" can be a noun or a verb). Passing in the entire sentence allows for more context to figure out what POS tag a word should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    >>> tagged_words = nltk.pos_tag(word_tokens)\n",
    "    >>> tagged_words\n",
    "    [('this', 'DT'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('sentence', 'NN')]`\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now utilize the sentence representations to build a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. A KNN classifier classifies a sentence by finding its nearest neighbors (in the embedding space) in the training data and taking a majority vote of the labels of neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " We will be working with the STS dataset from HW1, i.e. classifying the sentiment of movie reviews (we will consider both binary and 5-class classification case). You will implement the following class:\n",
    "\n",
    "`GloveKNNClassifier` with methods:\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initialize the classifier with the value of k and the choice of sentence embedding method (simple sum or sum with POS weights)\n",
    "- `fit`: Calculates the sentence embeddings for all sentences in the training data and stores them. Also stores the corresponding labels.\n",
    "- `predict`: Predicts the label(s) for the given sentence(s) using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The distance metric to use is cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower case the training as well as test sentences before computing their embeddings (if your `get_sentence_embedding` already handles that for you, you don't need to do it again here)\n",
    "\n",
    "- To avoid division by zero when calculating cosine similarity, you can add a small epsilon value i.e. 1e-8 to the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We strongly recommend implementing a vectorized version of `cosine_similarity` here, i.e. instead of one by one computing similarity between a test sentence and a training sentence, implement a function which takes n test sentences and m train sentences and uses matrix multiplication operations to get a similarity matrix of shape [n, m]"

    "While we haven't covered transformers based sentence embeddings in the class yet, we would like to give you a flavour of how the directly trained sentence level representations can be more powerful. We will be using the `sentence-transformers` library to get the sentence embeddings. Below we provide you with a helper function `get_st_embeddings` which takes in a list of sentences, and a sentence transformers model, and returns the sentence embeddings using the `sentence-transformers` library."
