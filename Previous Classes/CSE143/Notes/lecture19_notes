if you are writing comparable with double, you should use an if/else if/else, like so:
if (difference > 0) return 1;
else if (difference == 0) return 0;
else return -1;
this would work just fine, and is relatively simple.

// concerete class-----------------interfaces
// all filled in                   all abstract
//                      ??
//                 some of each

public abstract class Shape implements Comparable<Shape> {
	// needs to have an are() method
	public abstract double area();
	
	public int compareTo(Shape other) {
		double difference = area() - other.area();
		if (difference < 0) return -1;
		else if (difference == 0) return 0;
		else return 1;
	}
