   control: recursion
   data: linked lists, binary trees
   Java Collections Classes
   Riel:
      external: client, WHAT an object does
      internal: implementation, HOW an object works
   ArrayList<E>, ArrayIntList

style issues:
   want all fields to be initialized in a constructor   
   You must document every pre/post condition.
   every field should be private.
   CONSTANTS (i.e. static final) can be public
   if something is wrong, throw an exception.
   remember getters/setters
   this(some parameters) = calling the constructor w/ those parameters
   boolean zen
   whenever there is an appropriate interface to use, required to use it
      use LESS specific interface, instead of the certain type--e.g. List<> instead of ArrayList<>
      parameters, return values, variables, and fields should all be declared using interface types
   
Note: all objects of one class are friendly with each other--can access their own private fields

**If you are iterating over a structure like a set, you cannot call methods that change the structure.**
This is known as "ConcurrentModificationException"
do something instead like "itr2.remove()"
